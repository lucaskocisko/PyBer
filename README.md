# PyBer ridesharing analysis

## Overview 

This analysis reviews a startup ridesharing company. Pulls data from multiple sources, dated Jan-Apr 2019, on ride counts and city type. I will conduct further analysis on city type (ie; Rural, Suburban, Urban), driver count, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

## Results

## Summary

The Urban city type is the highest earning member.The fare summary looks somewhat volatile. The number of drivesr is a little oversaturated. 
Suburban city type fare summary shows little variance in the data(may be more predictable). The trajectory could be higher with more drivers.
Rural city type has the highest average fare. Increasing total number of rides would lead to more revenue.
